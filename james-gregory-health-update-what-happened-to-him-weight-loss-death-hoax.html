A supporter of the 76-year-old comic who has lost a lot of weight has raised concern for his health. Is the stand-up comedian sick then? What illness is he dealing with? Let’s look into it.</p><h2><span id=What_happened_to_the_health_and_illness_of_comedian_James_Gregory>What happened to the health and illness of comedian James Gregory?</span></h2><p class=toc_title>Page Contents</p><ul class=toc_list><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">1</span> What happened to the health and illness of comedian James Gregory?</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">2</span> James Gregory slims down</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">3</span> James Gregory the Comedian’s Death Scam</a></li><li><a href=#><span class="toc_number toc_depth_1">4</span> Personal Life of James Gregory</a></li></ul><p>The internet was stunned by the well-known comic James Gregory’s amazing weight loss. His devotees around the world think that his illness is to blame for his weight reduction. The comedian apparently lost close to 15 pounds while confined. He changes so quickly that many are shocked. While some believe the star worked out and toned down, many believe her weight loss was caused by illness.</p><p>James’ trademark is his chubby figure. He might not be recognizable to those who knew him when he was obese. Many reports claim that the comedian’s struggle to lose weight began after he suffered a stroke a while back. He performed poorly as a result of the stroke. For instance, he needed help remembering all the specifics of his routine. Strokes and weight reduction are probably related. He had trouble remembering some mundane facts, but he kept working.</p><h2><span id=James_Gregory_slims_down>James Gregory slims down</span></h2><p>James Gregory was questioned about his weight loss during an interview. He did not, however, fully reply. He didn’t seem to want to discuss it. James also recently made light of the fact that he bought bigger clothes to hide his weight. On the other hand, the pictures show how much he has shrunk. Gregory significantly reduced his weight.</p><p>One of his internet fans claimed that he is a private person who does not want to share any details about his personal life with his admirers. His prior strokes opened his eyes, according to some of his followers, and he is now looking forward to living a healthy life. Let’s hope that the funniest man in America will live a long, happy, and healthy life and continue to make others laugh and smile.</p><h2><span id=James_Gregory_the_Comedian8217s_Death_Scam>James Gregory the Comedian’s Death Scam</span></h2><p>Recently, false reports about James Gregory’s demise appeared online.
