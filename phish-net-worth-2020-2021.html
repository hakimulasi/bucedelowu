Their first performance was on 2nd December 1983 at the University’s cafeteria, Harris Millis Cafeteria. They played many classic rock covers in their first performance.</p><p>The group welcomed Tom Marshall, Anastasio’s childhood friend, when Anastasio faced a suspension because of a prank he pulled, and he returned to his hometown in New Jersey. The band then named themselves Phish, which was based on the nickname “Fish” they gave to Fishman, and they designed their logo in such a way that their group’s name is featured inside a fish.
