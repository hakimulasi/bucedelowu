He is a social media star, YouTuber and a hair stylist, who is known for having worked with many celebrities, such as the pop singer Vanessa Hudgens, the model Heather Marks and the actress Shay Mitchell.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=childhood-and-education></span>Childhood and education<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brad was raised in Franklin alongside his younger brother Eric, by their father who was a hairdresser and the owner of his own salon, and their mother who taught history at a local high school.</p><p>Brad became interested in modelling at a very early age, and because he was always kind of girlish, he was bullied at both elementary and high school. He found comfort in listening to music, being a member of the school’s drama club, and practicing his hair styling skills on wigs which his father bought for him. He matriculated in 2012, and decided not to pursue a college degree but to work on his career.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=career-as-a-social-media-star-and-a-hair-stylist></span>Career as a social media star and a hair stylist<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brad launched his Instagram account in 2013, and immediately started uploading pictures of his works – there are currently over 1.5 million people following him, while he has uploaded around 120 pictures onto the account.</p><p>Most of the pictures have his face in focus, as Brad believes he is very attractive and has beautiful eyes and hair. Brad is also using his Instagram account to promote his shampoo, XMondoHair.</p><p>He is also very active on YouTube, launching his channel on 28 April 2015, and there are currently over 6.1 million people subscribed to the channel, while Brad has gathered over 850 million views of all his videos combined. He uploads a variety of videos, including tests of cheap drugstore shampoos, reactions to do-it-yourself hair dyeing and giving tips and advice – two of his most popular videos are “HAIRDRESSER REACTS TO JOJO SIWA RUINING HER HAIR FOR 11 MINUTES STRAIGHT”, which has been seen over 20 million times since 6 October 2018 and “Hairdresser Reacts To Americas Next Top Model Makeovers S.24” which has also been seen around 20 million times since 28 January 2018.</p><p>Brad is also active on Facebook, and has gathered nearly three million followers on the network, while he’s also been active on Twitter since May 2017, on which there are currently around 160,000 people following him. He is lately devoting a lot of his spare time to his TikTok account, onto which he mostly uploads funny videos related to hair – there are over 6.2 million people following him, and he has gathered over 167 million likes. TikTok is currently one of the most popular social media networks on the internet, used for uploading short videos which are in most cases funny, but can also be scary, educational or motivational.</p><p>Brad is also selling his merchandise on the internet, including shirts, hoodies and other products.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=love-life-and-boyfriend></span>Love life and boyfriend<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brad has known he is gay since a very early age, but kept it hidden throughout elementary school, and not long after enrolling at a high school, he started seeing a girl and began telling everyone that he’s bisexual – only a couple of his closest friends knew that he was actually gay. After he tried to flirt with the boy he liked and told him that he was actually gay, the boy told everyone in the school about it, and this somewhat destroyed Brad, although most of his friends actually accepted him for what he is. Not long after that, Brad came out to his parents who already knew he was gay and were entirely okay with everything.</p><p>Brad hasn’t talked about any boys or men he might have dated, but it’s believed that he is currently seeing a man as several of his fans claim to have seen the two spending time together and kissing at a gay club in Los Angeles, but as Brad hasn’t commented on these rumors, he is single as of October 2020, hasn’t married and doesn’t have children.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hobbies-and-other-interests></span>Hobbies and other interests<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brad spends a lot of his free time at the gym, as he has several training sessions each week and is also following a strict diet – he doesn’t eat anything that has sugar in it (except fruits which have natural sugar), doesn’t eat fast food and rarely drinks alcohol.</p><p>Brad is a lover of animals, with dogs being his favorites, and he has a pet dog which can occasionally be seen featured in the pictures he uploads onto his Instagram account.</p><p>Brad is also keen on watching movies, and a few of his favorite actors are Neil Patrick Harris, Luke Macfarlane and Mitchell Anderson – a few of his favorite movies are “Brokeback Mountain”, “Call Me By Your Name” and “Moonlight”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=age-and-height></span>Age and height<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Brad is 25 years old. He has brown hair which he has dyed numerous colors, his eyes are brown as well, and he is 5ft 11ins (1.8m) tall while he weighs around 155lbs (71kgs). As of October 2020, his net worth has been estimated at over $2 million.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=twin-brothers-%e2%80%93-who-is-eric-mondo></span>Twin brothers – who is Eric Mondo?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Eric Mondo is not Brad’s twin brother as many people believe – he was born on 17 April 1992 in the US, his zodiac sing is Aries and he holds American nationality. He is a model, Instagram star and a YouTuber, who has collaborated with his brother on many occasions.</p><p>Eric grew up being interested in hair styling just as his brother, and is today perhaps best known for his Instagram account onto which he has gathered over 100,000 followers, and has uploaded around 160 pictures.</p><p>He doesn’t have his own YouTube channel, but he and Brad are running the channel “Brad & Eric” together, which they launched on 15 December 2017, which is subscribed to over 170,000 people, while it counts over 1.2 million views of their videos combined.</p><p>Eric is a huge lover of animals, and has a pet dog.</p><p>He is very sporting and prefers winter over summer as he is an avid skier.</p><p>Eric is also gay, and is currently in a relationship with a mysterious man.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJqilrFuuc6nm6hlopqurXnNmqSeZaSstq95waumraCVp8Burs6ynauhlaOxbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./brent-steffensen-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Brent Steffensen Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
