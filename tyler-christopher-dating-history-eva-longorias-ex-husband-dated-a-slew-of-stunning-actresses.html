sister, Susan Asmo Baker, since 2019, shared his journey towards reclaiming control of his life in an interview with Bloomberg.</p><p>He said, “I never thought in a million years that I would be taken advantage of by a family member.”</p><p>This came after Christopher's guardianship under his sister, Susan Asmo Baker, began when he experienced severe alcohol withdrawal. He had a fall that resulted in a head injury, leading to life-saving surgery due to internal bleeding.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Fans gush over The View's Ana Navarro as she shares photos of ‘amazing weekend’ with Eva Longoria and A-list friends</a></p><p>In 2008, Christopher tied the knot with former ESPN reporter Brienne Pedigo.

The couple later became parents to two children, Greysun James Christopher and Boheme Christopher. Their marriage reportedly ended in 2021 after Pedigo filed for divorce in 2019.</p><p>It was also reported that Christopher was previously engaged with ‘General Hospital’ co-star Vanessa Marcil and dated Natalia Livingston. However, it didn’t work out.</p><h2 class=split>Tyler Christopher and Eva Longoria’s short-lived marriage</h2><p>Eva Longoria, a prominent figure in today's entertainment world, initially made her mark in the daytime television realm through her role on ‘The Young and the Restless.’</p><p>During this time, she also found love with another soap opera star, Tyler Christopher, known for his appearances on ‘General Hospital’ and ‘Days of Our Lives.’</p><p>In the early 2000s, Christopher was a soap opera heartthrob, most notably for his portrayal of Nikolas Cassadine on ABC's hit soap.</p><p>Christopher's attachment to the role was evident in a 2017 interview with <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Soap Opera Digest</a>, where he expressed that a recast of Nikolas Cassadine “would sting a little bit."</p><p>He said at the time, "If they feel like they need Nikolas Cassadine on the canvas, of course I would be upset, but I wish whoever it is I wish them well and I hope they give the character as much of themselves as I gave to him."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/d6ehjqrqtzoun.cloudfront.net/fb22a88c-02ea-43f0-89fe-868354439925.527092630><p>Yet, it was the off-screen romance between Christopher and Longoria that captured the public's attention. Their initial meeting was orchestrated by Christopher’s co-star Vanessa Marcil, whom he had once been engaged to.</p><p>Longoria temporarily stepped in for Marcil, leading to months of on-and-off dating. In 2002, Christopher and Longoria tied the knot in Las Vegas, with Hollywood actors Freddie Prinze, Jr and Sarah Michelle Gellar as witnesses.</p><p>However, their marriage lasted only two years. Longoria, reflecting on her early union with Christopher, admitted to feeling like a "terrible wife," as per <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Digital Spy.</a></p><p>She said, “He was a lovely man, but I was very young. I didn't know who I was, and I was still struggling as an actor. I was a terrible wife.”</p><p>Following their divorce, Longoria married NBA star Tony Parker in 2007, but their marriage concluded in 2011.</p><p>In contrast, Christopher wed Brienne Pedigo, a reporter associated with ESPN and Motor Racing Network, in 2008, but the couple quietly parted ways in 2021.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Who is Tyler Christopher?
