He hasn’t said whether he runs any side businesses other than this. He has a $100,000 net worth as of 2022.</p><p>His wife, on the other hand, possesses $0.5 million in total assets. Her profession as a TV show star, producer, author, and entrepreneur has contributed to her income.</p><h2><span id=Detroit_Is_Where_Jacob_Payne_Was_Born>Detroit Is Where Jacob Payne Was Born.</span></h2><p>The football star, who will be 32 years old in 2022, was born in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States, in 1990. He was born under the sign of Cancer, and July 18th is his birthday. In addition, he is of Caucasian ethnicity and holds American citizenship.</p><p>Despite having been born and raised in Detroit, Payne eventually moved to Lansing to grow up with his family. There aren’t many details regarding his early life in the media because he was already an adult when he emerged into the spotlight. Furthermore, he has not discussed his parents or siblings.</p><p>In the meanwhile, he posted a photo to Instagram wishing Jalon Payne, his younger brother, a “Happy Birthday.” He may have two brothers because the picture shows two boys. We are unsure, though, if he has any more brothers or sisters.</p><p>Regarding his educational background, he finished his studies at Central Michigan. More information regarding his educational background is, however, confidential.</p><h2><span id=Who_Is_Jacob_Payne_the_Husband_of_Natalie_Nunn_His_Professional_Background>Who Is Jacob Payne, the Husband of Natalie Nunn? His Professional Background</span></h2><p>Professional football player Jacob Payne, who also refers to himself as a “fitness guru,” was a wide receiver with the Arizona Rattlers. It is incorrect that he was an NFL player, despite other myths to the contrary.</p><p>Payne gained attention despite his athletic career after his marriage to Natalie Nunn. In addition, he rose to fame with his wife’s appearances on the reality series Bridezillas and Marriage Boot Camp.</p><p>In addition, Payne enjoys listening to music these days. He posts his songs and music videos on his personal YouTube page. Still, he hasn’t achieved much success as a musician.</p><h2><span id=Jacob_Payne8217s_and_Natalie_Nunns8217_marriage_which_was_seen_on_reality_television>Jacob Payne’s and Natalie Nunns’ marriage, which was seen on reality television</span></h2><p>After dating for a while, the football player and the Baddies star exchanged vows on May 5, 2012. A month before their wedding, in April, he made her an engagement proposal. She accepted.</p><p>While enjoying a vacation in Negril on the island of Jamaica, Payne got down on one knee and proposed to her. Ready to become Mrs. Payne, the soon-to-be bride said “yes.” His then-girlfriend was taken by surprise during the holiday.</p><p>In Topanga Canyon, California, the couple held their wedding ceremony after a month. About 50 to 60 people, including their close friends and family, attended the private party at one of their friends’ estates.</p><p>The footage from Jacob and Natalie’s private wedding was shown on three episodes of Bridezillas on We TV. The videos of their ceremony served to silence many who were criticizing them for being phony.</p><h2><span id=When_Was_the_First_Time_Jacob_Natalie_Nunn_Met>When Was the First Time Jacob & Natalie Nunn Met?</span></h2><p>Although most individuals don’t think of love at first sight, Payne and his husband experienced it. When they first saw one other in 2011 at a Detroit bar, they felt an immediate connection.</p><p>The reality TV actress was there for work, but her ex-boyfriend and his friends, as well as the club promoter, were already there. She quickly became involved with him after falling in love with him at first sight. In a 2012 interview, Jacob’s sweetheart talked about it.</p><p>Natalie Nunn stated,</p><p>He was so attractive and personable that I fell in love right away. After that, he visited me in Los Angeles and never returned.</p><p>At the time, the husband and wife had a long-distance relationship because they resided in different cities. It wasn’t always that way, though, as the well-known husband moved in with his girlfriend after two months of an affair when he visited Los Angeles.</p><h2><span id=Payne_Is_A_Daughter8217s_Father>Payne Is A Daughter’s Father</span></h2><p>After the couple was married, Jacob Payne and Nunn had a child together. The wife announced the arrival of their first child on Instagram on November 22, 2016, and the couple was overjoyed.</p><p>Jacob Payne, along with his daughter Journey and wife Natalie Nunn Ruth Jacob Payne, wife Natalie Nunn, and daughter Journey Ruth Natalie said that her prayers had been answered regarding the birth of a child. In actuality, at the time of the baby girl’s announcement, she was already 20 weeks pregnant. They eventually welcomed a stunning daughter, Journey Ruth Payne, on April 16, 2017.</p><h2><span id=His_spouse_experienced_a_previous_miscarriage>His spouse experienced a previous miscarriage.</span></h2><p>The member of Bad Girl Club had revealed her pregnancy in November 2014, before Journey was born. She did, however, keep the details of her first pregnancy miscarriage discreet. However, she admitted to having gone through the traumatic ordeal when questioned about pretending to be incubated.</p><p>She experienced weight gain and despair, which is why she frequented the gym. Nevertheless, without understanding the whole story, the public conjectured incorrectly.</p><h2><span id=Was_Jacob_Payne8217s_Wife_Unfaithful_to_Him>Was Jacob Payne’s Wife Unfaithful to Him?</span></h2><p>The revelation that Payne’s spouse had been unfaithful to him upended his previously stable situation. The media first reported about Natalie’s threesome with her co-stars on Celebrity Big Brother in 2019.</p><p>After a wild night of partying in London in 2018, Chloe Ayling surprisingly came clean to the public and admitted to having a sex act with Dan Osbourne and the Bad Girl Natalie.</p><p>Chloe said</p><p>Dan had an affair with Jacqueline by using Natalie and me. After drinking a lot, there was a threesome.</p><p>The co-star on CBB continued, saying</p><p>“He kissed me and pulled a sex act on me after having full sex with Natalie in front of me in the bathroom.”</p><h2><span id=Says_Jacob_Payne_Dan_Osborne_attempted_to_get_back_together_with_his_spouse_Natalie>Says Jacob Payne Dan Osborne attempted to get back together with his spouse, Natalie.</span></h2><p>For several months, Dan reportedly tried to meet Natalie and even sent her a message. She did not, however, go meet him. A reliable source stated</p><p>“Dan was eager to see Natalie; the two of them were going to go out to dinner or a club.”</p><p>The 32-year-old refused to allow his husband to meet with Osborne after learning about the DMs. He even believed that Dan was interested in hooking up with the reality TV celebrity and thought it was unusual for a married man to go out on his own with a woman.</p><h2><span id=Are_Natalie_and_Jacob_still_dating>Are Natalie and Jacob still dating?</span></h2><p>The Payne was, of course, utterly devastated by the news. On December 6, 2019, he broke up with Natalie and packed up his belongings to leave the house. The single parent claimed he is staying with his friend because he needs some alone time and will discover the truth.</p><p>Subsequently, he was seen wandering London by himself without his wedding bands, leading some to speculate that they were divorcing.</p><p>Still, near the end of the same week, the couple was spotted having a passionate moment together on the streets of London. Perhaps they worked things out between them because they weren’t ready to give up on each other. They then attended the Marriage Boot Camp to strengthen their bond.</p><p>He Dislikes Natalie Acting Like a Bad Girl<br>Jacob Payne is likewise possessive of his wife, much like other men. He disapproves of his spouse engaging in bad girl activities like twerking and sharing half-naked photos on her Instagram. This is the primary cause of the couple’s frequent arguments.</p><p>Natalie is thus striving to be a decent wife and doing her best to keep her marriage intact, especially in light of the scandal. Additionally, she mentioned that attending Marriage Boot Camp had somewhat improved their relationship. She acknowledged that she can’t always be a good girl and is working to control her inner bad girl.</p><h2><span id=Is_Jacob_Payne_Using_Instagram_Actively>Is Jacob Payne Using Instagram Actively?</span></h2><p>Yes, he does have a Jacob Payne Instagram account with 43.9K followers and 76 posts. He uses this platform to stay updated about himself and his family and to be active.</p><p><span data-sheets-root=1 data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Maxwell Bradley Garrett, Ceren Alkac, and Camaron Engel."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":1053569,"3":{"1":0},"10":2,"11":0,"12":0,"15":"Arial","23":1}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":34}{"1":36,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":47}{"1":53,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}{"1":66}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/maxwell-bradley-garrett/"}{"1":34}{"1":36,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/ceren-alkac/"}{"1":47}{"1":53,"2":"https://superstarsculture.com/camaron-engels/"}{"1":66}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Maxwell Bradley Garrett</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Ceren Alkac</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Camaron Engel</a>.</span></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/superstarsculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Untitled-design-1.jpg alt="Easy way to win money online (1)" width=550 height=100 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Football Player</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><a href=# rel=prev><span>Previous Article</span><p>Marquise Jackson | Relationship And Net Worth</p></a><a href=# rel=next><span>Next Article</span><p>Is Playboi Carti Christian | Religion Ethnicity And Origin</p></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpaWys7%2FTmqmsm6Whwba%2BxGeaqKVfn66ku8Fmp5qxnpp6uLXFnmSnmaSWuaqxjKesp6Zdoq6zvsiem2akmZuycA%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./javier-vazquez-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Javier Vazquez Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth</a>
