My siblings and I studied via his staff benefit, and as a result, the social-class discrepancies between ourselves and other learners at school were very evident.”<p class=align-left>The good prof notes that her parents inspired her love of <a href=#>education</a>, since her mother also worked as a teacher for a short period:</p>“Of greatest value to me is how they taught me that even as a girl child, I could acquire the greatest heights of education possible if I put my heart and mind to it.”<h2>The University of Johannesburg academic originally wanted to be a medical doctor</h2><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Musawenkosi</a> fondly notes that her family members called her ‘Dr Musa’ when she was younger, and she had hopes of pursuing medicine at university:</p>“I was good at science and loved the idea of earning that ‘Dr’ title.“Little did any of us know at the time that while it was indeed in my blueprint to one day become a doctor, I would become a Doctor of Philosophy rather than a medical professional.”<p class=align-left>The supermom explains that towards the end of her high school career, she realised that medicine was not her calling; a notion that took her parents by surprise:</p>“I ultimately decided to pursue a commercial course but was still unsure of what exactly."<p class=align-left>Since the talented young woman was undecided about which career path to choose, her parents helped her select possible courses to pursue, with economics, accounting, and human resource management the three study areas she applied for.</p><p class=align-left><strong>Briefly News</strong> previously wrote that at 16, Musawenkosi went on to <a href=#>study human resource management </a>at NWU, obtaining her degree at 19.</p><p class=align-left>At the ages of 20 and 21, respectively, she then bagged her honours and master’s degrees, later obtaining her PhD in Industrial and Organisational Psychology at the same institution.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/e115e1930c7281ee.png><h2>The prof uses her position to empower young women of colour</h2><p class=align-left>Musawenkosi alludes that being a lecturer and research supervisor affords her the opportunity to make young ladies aware of the importance of capitalising on opportunities they are presented with.</p><p class=align-left>However, the prof notes that as a black female, she still finds herself being underestimated in academia at times, especially because of her age.</p><p class=align-left>But despite all the challenges she faces, the inspiring researcher continues to excel as an academic, while having a family of her own to nurture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-briefly.akamaized.net/images/8368d09d5ade3baf.png><p class=align-left>Musawenkosi advises young women who want to be academics and have families to be careful about whom they marry and get into relationships with, as this decision could have a huge impact on their careers:</p>“Also, ladies, believe in yourselves. You are magnificent, capable, worthy, and good enough. If no one ever told you this growing up, start making an effort to convince yourself of it and live it!”<h2>Limpopo woman goes from being typist clerk to senior lecturer, PhD graduate from University of Venda</h2><p class=align-left>Meanwhile, in another story, <strong>Briefly News</strong> also wrote about an inspiring lady from <a href=#>Limpopo</a> <a href=#>who worked her way up</a> from being a typist clerk to a senior lecturer at the University of Venda.</p><p class=align-left>Nyawasedza Phellecy Lavhelani only had matric and computer certificates when she started working at the institution and now holds an entire PhD.
