separation, several hours after his initial upload.</p><p class=p1><i>Original story continues below:</i></p><p><a href=#><strong>Tori Spelling</strong></a> and <strong><a href=#>Dean McDermott</a></strong> have <a href=#>called it quits after more than a decade</a> of marriage.</p><p class=p1>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs with great sadness and a very very heavy heart that after 18 years together and 5 amazing children, that&nbsp;@torispelling&nbsp;and I have decided to go our separate ways and start a new journey of our own,‚Äù McDermott, 56, wrote via<a href=#> Instagram</a> on Saturday, June 17, sharing throwback photos of the pair. ‚ÄúWe will continue to work together as loving parents and guide and love our children through this difficult time. We ask that you all respect our privacy as we take this time to surround our family with love and work our way through this. Thank you all for your support and kindness.&nbsp;<span class=s1>üôè</span>.‚Äù</p><p class=p1>Spelling, 50, has not publicly addressed the split, though stepped out with her now-estranged husband earlier this week for their <a href=#>daughter Stella‚Äôs 15th birthday party</a> at the Beverly Hills Hilton. Several days prior, the duo brought their youngest four children ‚Äî Stella, Hattie, 11, Finn, 10, and Beau, 6 ‚Äî to <a href=#>the Stand for Kids Gala in Los Angeles</a>. (They also share son Liam, 16.)</p><p>The <a href=#>Beverly Hills, 90210</a> alum exchanged vows with McDermott in May 2006. Less than one month before their private ceremony in Fiji, Spelling finalized her divorce from actor and writer <strong>Charlie Shanian</strong> after two years of marriage. The former Chopped Canada host, for his part, was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Mary Jo Eustace</strong></a>, with whom he shares 24-year-old son Jack. Both Spelling and McDermott have been open about <a href=#>cheating on their first spouses</a> when they met on the set of Mind Over Murder in 2005.</p><p>In March 2021, the twosome sparked split rumors when Spelling was <a href=#>spotted without her wedding ring</a> in Moorpark, California, just outside of Los Angeles. Three months later, speculation grew stronger after the actress revealed that she and McDermott were sleeping in separate beds. At the time, a source told Us Weekly that <a href=#>the pair were ‚Äúhaving major issues.‚Äù</a></p><p>As fans wondered whether the duo‚Äôs marriage was on the rocks, both Spelling and the Pretty Hard Cases actor played coy about the rumors. By October 2021, a source told Us that <a href=#>the ‚Äú90210MG‚Äù podcast host ‚Äúwant[ed] a divorce, but she [felt] trapped.‚Äù</a></p><p>The Stori Telling author sparked further speculation in November 2021 when <a href=#>she posted a family holiday card</a> via Instagram that didn‚Äôt include her husband. ‚ÄúWith Love, from our farm to your home! Xoxo, Tori & Family,‚Äù the card‚Äôs signature read. In a second photo, the actress hung personalized Christmas stockings on the family mantle, but <a href=#>there was notably no stocking for McDermott</a>.</p><p>When an Instagram follower made a comment about the actor‚Äôs absence, Spelling replied, ‚ÄúFact: @imdeanmcdermott was filming his new feature film in Canada.‚Äù Us later confirmed that <a href=#>the pair ‚Äúspent Christmas as a family‚Äù</a> and celebrated the 2021 holidays ‚Äúunder one roof.‚Äù</p><p>Spelling and McDermott previously renewed their vows in May 2010, three years before <a href=#>Us&nbsp;broke the news</a> that the Slasher star cheated on Spelling with another woman while filming in Canada. The aftermath of the scandal was documented for two seasons on their Lifetime reality series, True Tori, which aired in 2014.</p><p>When his infidelity made headlines, McDermott <a href=#>voluntarily checked himself into a rehab facility</a>. The twosome eventually got their marriage back on track ‚Äî but it wasn‚Äôt easy.</p><p>‚ÄúI thought that Tori was just going to <a href=#>run for the hills</a>, and I could totally understand why,‚Äù the Gourmet Dad cookbook author told Us exclusively in November 2019, reflecting on how he and Spelling conquered their issues. ‚ÄúBut she was like, ‚ÄòI just can‚Äôt turn off the love for you. I love you. You hurt me. I‚Äôm angry, but I love you. I can‚Äôt turn that off.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ Every relationship is work, and when you get to that point, you can‚Äôt bail. You got to knuckle under and work it out. It is hard.‚Äù</p><p>The Masked Singer alum and McDermott haven‚Äôt shied away from <a href=#>speaking about their ups and downs</a> through the years ‚Äî and they haven‚Äôt been able to hide their past from their kids. In August 2020, Spelling revealed that <a href=#>one of her daughters got ‚Äúreally upset‚Äù</a> after coming across stories about the duo‚Äôs struggles online. The Last Sharknado: It‚Äôs About Time actress also admitted at the time that infidelity was already her ‚Äúbiggest fear‚Äù before McDermott cheated.</p><p>‚ÄúWhen it happened, I was like, ‚ÄòSee, I always thought from day one he was going to cheat on me.‚Äô And it wasn‚Äôt about him, that was about me,‚Äù the California native said on the ‚ÄúWomen on Top‚Äù podcast. ‚ÄúI was like, ‚ÄòOK, I know I‚Äôm not good enough.‚Äô That‚Äôs how I felt about myself and one day he‚Äôs going to realize that and he‚Äôs gonna find someone else.‚Äù</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Before they called it quits, <a href=#>McDermott offered a bit of advice</a> to couples who might be working through similar issues to what he and Spelling faced throughout their marriage.</p><p>‚ÄúDon‚Äôt have a knee-jerk reaction,‚Äù he told Us in November 2019. ‚ÄúI understand the knee-jerk reaction. I totally understand it, but look at your relationship outside of the kids if you have them. ‚Ä¶ Just stop and breathe and look at the relationship and how much you mean to each other. And if that‚Äôs not there, then go your separate ways. But if there‚Äôs that flame, that kindred spirit, that connection, if it‚Äôs still there, hash it out, work it out. It‚Äôs not the end.‚Äù</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp6KeerS8xKWjoqaXYrGmrc1mpJyclae6sMDTZqqppJmpeqKy056pZmlnYsamrdGsZKieXaKus77Imp6eZw%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./trina-braxton-net-worth-2020-2021.html>&#171;&nbsp;Trina Braxton Net Worth 2024: Age, Height, Weight, Husband, Kids, Bio-Wiki</a>
