Nelson has also appeared on television in such shows as the musical drama "Empire" and the NBC sitcom "Suddenly Susan."</p><h2 id=early-life-career-beginnings><strong>Early Life and Career Beginnings</strong></h2><p>Judd Asher Nelson was born in 1959 in Portland, Maine to a Jewish family.

Afterward, he moved to Manhattan, where he studied acting under legendary acting teacher Stella Adler.</p><p>Nelson made his film debut in 1983 in "Rock 'n' Roll Hotel." The next year, he starred in the teen comedy "Making the Grade," and in early 1985, appeared opposite <a href=# title="Kevin Costner Net Worth">Kevin Costner</a> in the fraternity comedy "Fandango."</p><h2 id=brat-pack-1980s-movie-stardom><strong>The Brat Pack and 1980s Movie Stardom</strong></h2><p>Shortly following "Fandango," Nelson had his claim to fame with the release of the <a href=# title="John Hughes Net Worth">John Hughes</a> high school classic "The Breakfast Club."
