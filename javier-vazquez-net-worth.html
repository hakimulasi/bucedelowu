worth of $40 million. During his career he pitched for the Florida Marlins, Atlanta Braves, Chicago White Sox, Arizona Diamondbacks, New York Yankees and Montreal Expos.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Javier VÃ¡zquez was born on July 25, 1976 in Ponce, Puerto Rico. He grew up in a baseball family, as his father was a coach and his brother was also a professional baseball player. VÃ¡zquez attended high school in Puerto Rico, where he played baseball and was scouted by several Major League teams.</p><h2 id=baseball-career><strong>Baseball Career</strong></h2><p>VÃ¡zquez was drafted by the Montreal Expos in the fifth round of the 1994 MLB Draft, and he made his Major League debut with the team in 1998. He spent six seasons with the Expos, establishing himself as one of the team's top pitchers. In 2003, he was traded to the New York Yankees, where he had one of the best seasons of his career, winning 15 games and earning his first All-Star selection.</p><p>Following a four walk, two strikeout performance and game seven loss to the Boston Red Sox in the 2004 American League Championship Series, the Yankees sent VÃ¡zquez, Brad <a href=# title="Halsey Net Worth">Halsey</a>, and Dioner Navarro, to the Arizona Diamondbacks in exchange for <a href=# title="Randy Johnson Net Worth">Randy Johnson</a> in 2005.</p><p>After pitching the 2005 season with Arizona, VÃ¡zquez formally requested a trade from the team, asking for a location that was "easier for his family in Puerto Rico to visit. On December 20, 2005, VÃ¡zquez was traded to the Chicago White Sox for <a href=# title="Orlando HernÃ¡ndez Net Worth">Orlando HernÃ¡ndez</a>, Luis VizcaÃ­no, and <a href=# title="Chris Young Net Worth">Chris Young</a>. He would go on to win a World Series with the White Sox.</p><p>During the 2007 season he struck out 213 and walked 50 in 216 innings pitched. VÃ¡zquez agreed to play for the Puerto Rico Team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, joining fellow Puerto Rican players representing the island in a team managed by St. Louis Cardinals third base coach Jose Oquendo. In 2008, VÃ¡zquez was traded to the Atlanta Braves.</p><p>In 2009, VÃ¡zquez had what was perhaps his most successful season with 238 strikeouts and 44 walks in 219 innings. Due to this successful season, the New York Yankees re-acquired VÃ¡zquez, banking on his reputation as one of the top starters in baseball. In 2010, he became the third active pitcher to beat all 30 MLB teams along with <a href=# title="Barry Zito Net Worth">Barry Zito</a> and <a href=# title="Jamie Moyer Net Worth">Jamie Moyer</a>. Unfortunately, he struggled during the regular season and the Yankees temporarily demoted him to the bullpen.</p><p>Following the 2010 season he reached an agreement on a one-year, $7 million contract with the Florida Marlins. He finished out the 2011 series that resulted in a knee injury that required right meniscus surgery.</p><p>He retired from baseball in 2012 with a career record of 165 wins and 160 losses, a 4.22 earned run average (ERA), and 2,536 strikeouts.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-251526 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/GettyImages-103411346.jpg alt="Javier Vazquez" width=594 height=399 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-251526 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><h2 id=contracts-amp-career-earnings><strong>Contracts & Career Earnings</strong></h2><p>Over the course of his career, VÃ¡zquez signed several lucrative contracts with various teams. In 2004, he signed a four-year, $45 million contract with the Yankees, which was at the time the largest contract ever given to a Latin American pitcher. He later signed a three-year, $34.5 million contract with the White Sox, and a two-year, $16 million contract with the Braves. In total, VÃ¡zquez earned over $110 million in salary over the course of his career.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>VÃ¡zquez is married and has two children. He is known for his charitable work, particularly in Puerto Rico, where he has supported several causes related to education and youth development. After retiring from baseball, VÃ¡zquez has remained involved in the sport, working as a pitching coach and scout for various teams.</p><p>In 2020, VÃ¡zquez was named in a lawsuit against former MLB pitcher Mike Bolsinger, who claimed that VÃ¡zquez's performance in a game against his team in 2017 was suspicious and appeared to be the result of sign-stealing. The lawsuit alleged that VÃ¡zquez was part of a scheme to steal signs and gain a competitive advantage. VÃ¡zquez denied the allegations, and the lawsuit is ongoing.</p><p>Despite the controversy, VÃ¡zquez is widely regarded as one of the best Puerto Rican pitchers in MLB history, and he has been honored with several awards and accolades for his achievements on the field. He remains a popular figure in Puerto Rico and in the baseball community more broadly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkv6qvx56qrWWSlsCmrsClo2iikau2pr6Mr5izqaWax266xK1ksKeiqbVw</p></div><div id=links><a href=./julianis-locks-to-my-socks-lyrics.html>&#171;&nbsp;Julianis Locks to My Socks Lyrics</a>
